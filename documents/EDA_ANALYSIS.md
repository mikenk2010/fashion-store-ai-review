## Problem Definition and Business Context

### Business Challenge
Online fashion retailers face the critical challenge of automatically determining product recommendations based on customer reviews. Manual labeling is time-consuming and subjective, while automated systems must balance accuracy with interpretability. Our system addresses this by implementing an advanced ensemble approach that combines multiple machine learning paradigms.

### Technical Approach
We implement a three-model ensemble system:
- **Model 1**: Logistic Regression with Bag-of-Words (BoW) features
- **Model 2**: Random Forest with spaCy unweighted embeddings  
- **Model 3**: Support Vector Machine (SVM) with TF-IDF weighted embeddings
- **Fusion Strategy**: Majority voting with confidence averaging

### Business Objectives
1. **Automated Review Classification**: Develop models that can automatically classify reviews as recommended (1) or not recommended (0)
2. **High Accuracy**: Achieve superior classification performance through ensemble methods
3. **Real-time Integration**: Create models suitable for real-time prediction in web applications
4. **Interpretability**: Provide confidence scores and individual model insights for transparency
