## üö® Troubleshooting

### If Docker fails:
1. Make sure Docker is running
2. Check that `data/data-assignment3_II.csv` exists
3. Try `docker-compose down` then `docker-compose up --build`

### If manual setup fails:
1. Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Make sure MongoDB is running
3. Run `python train_model.py` first

## [COMPLETE] Success!
